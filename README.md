# annuity
Quick exercise to unpack the true value of annuities quoted in site and the assumptions in their quotes.  
My question was, at what time do they expect you to die for them to break even, if you live longer then they lose money, and if you live less then they make money.  

Spoiler, seems that they are using an expected lifetime of 80 years old, and the coupon rate they offer is not that impressive when you take into account the future value of the principal.  Seems like you are still better off putting the money in the S&P500.
